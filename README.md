# whatsapp-choose-option-webpages

## locality.html 
This file shows ordered list of mdms values which are linked to a whatsapp number. 

WhatsApp Number and TenantId are expected from queryParams when opening this webpage. (_mobile=_----- _&tenantId=_-----)

locality.html can be replicated to show different mdms values. The only changes required are :
1. Change Title and Heading of the page.
2. Change moduleName, masterName, filterPath defined near top of the file.
